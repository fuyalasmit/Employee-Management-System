## Usage

1. **Admin Login**:
   - Email: `admin@me.com`
   - Password: `123`
   - After logging in, the admin can create tasks and assign them to employees.

2. **Employee Login**:

   - Employees can view their task list and check the task status.

   ## Limitations

- **localStorage Usage**: Data persistence relies on `localStorage`, which is not suitable for large-scale applications or sensitive data.
- **Lack of Backend**: The app currently has no backend, so itâ€™s limited to single-device usage.
- **Limited Role Management**: Only basic admin and employee roles are implemented, without any advanced permissions.
